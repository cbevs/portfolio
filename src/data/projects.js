      "Originally ClimbFind, Boulder Buddy is an application that seeks to help boulderers (rock climbers who stick to smaller walls) find climbs that have features that they want to either develop more skills in or enjoy doing. By selecting the features they want (for example, a specific type of hand hold), the application will serve up any climbs that have that feature linked to them. A user can also tick (mark complete) any climbs that they have done, so as to help them track their climbing progress. Users can also add new climbing locations as well as climbs. Climbs also include helpful information such as the weather at a certain climb and a map with a PIN on the area it belongs to.",

      "Plan It allows users of the future to be able to post reviews for planets they have visited. Users can also add new planets to review, as well as upvote and downvote other userâ€™s reviews. PlanIt was built to help develop the skills involved in group based-programming. Most of the coding done was pair-programming and all decisions made about the application were brought to each team member, so every person had a say. It also helped foster the skills needed to create and maintain a functional application.",

      "Cheer is a mental health tracking application that accepts a user's current mood and any possible factors as input. Using this data, it then provides visual charts to help a person see trends in their moods and see what factors tend to be catalysts for moods. I built this program not only to have a mental health tracking application to use, but also to learn new to me technologies such as Prisma and D3.",
